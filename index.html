                <div class="content">
                    <p>Drowsiness refers to a state of being sleepy or lethargic, often characterized by reduced
                        alertness and a strong urge to sleep. It can result from various factors such as inadequate
                        sleep, certain medications, medical conditions like sleep disorders, or even boredom. Drowsiness
                        can affect cognitive functions, reaction times, and overall performance, making it dangerous
                        when involved in activities that require attention and concentration, such as driving or
                        operating machinery.

                    <p>We have designed a device called SafeDrive to prevent drivers from falling asleep while driving
                        on highways and enhance the road safety. These smart anti-sleeping glasses incorporate IOT and
                        Technology to detect the signs of driver fatigue and intervene before accidents occur.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Equipped with special sensors, these glasses can detect when a driver is feeling sleepy. Once
                        sleepiness is detected, the glasses activate an alert system, which includes a loud buzzer to
                        wake up the driver and a message sent to the vehicle's onboard computer to slow down.
                        If the driver doesn't wake up after several alerts, the glasses instruct the vehicle to stop
                        completely, preventing potential accidents. Additionally, the glasses turn on special parking
                        lights to alert other drivers of the stopped vehicle.

                <div class="content">
                    <p>The glasses send a message to the manager of the truck or bus, providing the live location of the
                        vehicle and alerting them to the driver's condition, enabling timely intervention and
                        assistance. This integrated approach ensures that drivers remain alert and safe while on the
                        road, while also notifying relevant parties in case of emergencies.</p>
